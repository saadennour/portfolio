      "Korpo set out to connect professionals with opportunities through a modern, approachable platform. I took charge of designing and developing the landing page that would represent the brand’s identity. From structuring the layout to choosing the right visual language, I focused on building a multilingual, responsive site that could engage users from different backgrounds. I also integrated Supabase for managing the waitlist, ensuring the platform could smoothly start gathering its first community. Seeing the project go live at korpo.co was particularly rewarding — it was proof of how my design and development work helped bring Korpo from an idea to a functioning product.",

      "BrainDo began as an idea to make learning less overwhelming and more personalized for students preparing for big exams like the Baccalauréat or A-levels. My responsibility was to bring that idea to life on the web by building its first digital presence. I designed using Figma and developed the landing page with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, making sure the interface was clean, responsive, and easy to navigate. I also implemented a waitlist form to collect early signups, connecting future users directly to the platform's vision.",

      "Gini's mission was to simplify financial services for both individuals and microfinance institutions, with features like instant loan requests, AI-powered risk scoring, and gamified loan recovery. My role was to translate those ambitious goals into a clear and engaging digital interface. I designed and built UI elements that balanced professionalism with approachability, such as glowing feature cards on a dark-themed background. On the front-end side, I made sure these designs were implemented seamlessly, delivering a polished and user-friendly showcase of Gini’s solutions. The challenge was to capture the complexity of financial technology while keeping the experience accessible — a balance I focused on achieving throughout my work.",
